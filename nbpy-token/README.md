# North Bay Python Token

Resources for creating a 2cm token of a variation of the North Bay Python Logo for the SVGs, Lasers, Reality, and You presentation in 2023.

Note that while some designs are `.svg`, the final design was printed using the `.3dm` file created with Rhino3D due to the process not supporting svg gradients, among other things.

The Rhino file contains a reference to `token_gradient.png`, which is a raster export of the image to be engraved.
